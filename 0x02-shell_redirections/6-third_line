# This script displays the second line of the file named 'iacta'.
# The task title "6. Line #2" suggests extracting the second line.
# The 'head -n 2 iacta' command reads the file 'iacta' and outputs
# its first two lines.
# This output is then piped ('|') as input to the 'tail -n 1' command.
# 'tail -n 1' takes its input and outputs only the very last line of that input,
# which in this case will be the second line of the original 'iacta' file.
