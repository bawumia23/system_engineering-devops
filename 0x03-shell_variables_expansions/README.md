This directory contains tasks and scripts focused on **Linux shell variables, initialization files, and expansions**. The exercises here are designed to build practical understanding of how to customize and interact dynamically with the Bash shell environment.

## Learning Objectives

Through these tasks, I aim to learn:
-   The difference between local and environment variables.
-   How to declare, assign, and use shell variables.
-   The purpose and usage of shell initialization files (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`).
-   How to create and manage aliases and functions.
-   Different types of shell expansions (variable, brace, command, arithmetic) and their applications.

## Files and Their Purposes

-   `0-alias`: A script that creates a specific alias.
-   `1-hello_you`: A script that prints a personalized greeting to the current user.
-   `2-path`: A script that adds a directory to the system's `PATH`.
-   `3-paths`: A script that counts the number of directories in the `PATH`.
-   `4-global_variables`: A script that lists all environment variables.
-   `5-local_variables`: A script that lists all shell variables and functions (both local and global).
-   `6-create_local_variable`: A script demonstrating the creation of a local variable.
-   `7-create_global_variable`: A script demonstrating the creation of a global (environment) variable.
-   `8-true_knowledge`: A script that performs an arithmetic addition involving an environment variable.
-   `9-divide_and_rule`: A script that performs an arithmetic division using environment variables.
-   `10-love_exponent_breath`: A script that performs an arithmetic exponentiation using environment variables.
